  "body": " Co-Varying Quantities     If we have two quantities that are changing in tandem, how can we connect the quantities and understand how change in one affects the other?    When the amount of water in a tank is changing, what behaviors can we observe?      Mathematics is the art of making sense of patterns. One way that patterns arise is when two quantities are changing in tandem. In this setting, we may make sense of the situation by expressing the relationship between the changing quantities through words, through images, through data, or through a formula.    Suppose that a rectangular aquarium is being filled with water. The tank is feet long by feet wide by feet high, and the hose that is filling the tank is delivering water at a rate of cubic feet per minute.    The empty aquarium.     The aquarium, partially filled.        What are some different quantities that are changing in this scenario?    After minute has elapsed, how much water is in the tank? At this moment, how deep is the water?    How much water is in the tank and how deep is the water after minutes? After minutes?    How long will it take for the tank to be completely full? Why?         Using Graphs to Represent Relationships  In Preview Activity , we saw how several changing quantities were related in the setting of an aquarium filling with water: time, the depth of the water, and the total amount of water in the tank are all changing, and any pair of these quantities changes in related ways. One way that we can make sense of the situation is to record some data in a table. For instance, observing that the tank is filling at a rate of cubic feet per minute, this tells us that after minute there will be cubic feet of water in the tank, and after minutes there will be cubic foot of water in the tank, and so on. If we let denote the time in minutes and the amount of water in the tank at time , we can represent the relationship between these quantities through Table .    Data for how the volume of water in the tank changes with time.                                  A visual representation of the data in Table .     We can also represent this data in a graph by plotting ordered pairs on a system of coordinate axes, where represents the horizontal distance of the point from the origin, , and represents the vertical distance from . The visual representation of the table of values from Table is seen in the graph in Figure .  Sometimes it is possible to use variables and one or more equations to connect quantities that are changing in tandem. In the aquarium example from the preview activity, we can observe that the volume, , of a rectangular box that has length , width , and height is given by , and thus, since the water in the tank will always have length feet and width feet, the volume of water in the tank is directly related to the depth of water in the tank by the equation . Depending on which variable we solve for, we can either see how depends on through the equation , or how depends on via the equation . From either perspective, we observe that as depth or volume increases, so must volume or depth correspondingly increase.    Consider a tank in the shape of an inverted circular cone (point down) where the tank's radius is feet and its depth is feet. Suppose that the tank is being filled with water that is entering at a constant rate of cubic feet per minute.     Sketch a labeled picture of the tank, including a snapshot of there being water in the tank prior to the tank being completely full.    What are some quantities that are changing in this scenario? What are some quantities that are not changing?    Fill in the following table of values to determine how much water, , is in the tank at a given time in minutes, , and thus generate a graph of the relationship between volume and time by plotting the data on the provided axes.    Table to record data on volume and time in the conical tank.                                  How volume and time change in tandem in the conical tank.       Finally, think about how the height, , of the water changes in tandem with time. Without attempting to determine specific values of at particular values of , how would you expect the data for the relationship between and to appear? Use the provided axes to sketch at least two possibilities; write at least one sentence to explain how you think the graph should appear.             Using Algebra to Add Perspective  One of the ways that we make sense of mathematical ideas is to view them from multiple perspectives. We may use different means to establish different points of view: words, numerical data, graphs, or symbols. In addition, sometimes by changing our perspective within a particular approach we gain deeper insight.    The empty conical tank.     The conical tank, partially filled.     If we consider the conical tank discussed in Activity , as seen in Figure and Figure , we can use algebra to better understand some of the relationships among changing quantities. The volume of a cone volume cone with radius and height is given by the formula .  Note that at any time while the tank is being filled, (the radius of the surface of the water), (the depth of the water), and (the volume of the water) are all changing; moreover, all are connected to one another. Because of the constraints of the tank itself (with radius feet and depth feet), it follows that as the radius and height of the water change, they always do so in the proportion . Solving this last equation for , we see that ; substituting this most recent result in the equation for volume, it follows that .  This most recent equation helps us understand how and change in tandem. We know from our earlier work that the volume of water in the tank increases at a constant rate of cubic feet per minute. This leads to the data shown in Table .   How time and volume change in tandem in a conical tank.                       With the equation , we can now also see how the height of the water changes in tandem with time. Solving the equation for , note that , and therefore . Thus, when , it follows that . Executing similar computations with the other values of in Table , we get the following updated data that now includes .   How time, volume, and height change in concert in a conical tank.                                Plotting this data on two different sets of axes, we see the different ways that and change with . Whereas volume increases at a constant rate, as seen by the straight line appearance of the points in Figure , we observe that the water's height increases in a way that it rises more slowly as time goes on, as shown by the way the curve the points lie on in Figure  bends down as time passes.    Plotting versus .     Plotting versus .     These different behaviors make sense because of the shape of the tank. Since at first there is less volume relative to depth near the cone's point, as water flows in at a constant rate, the water's height will rise quickly. But as time goes on and more water is added at the same rate, there is more space for the water to fill in order to make the water level rise, and thus the water's height rises more and more slowly as time passes.    Conclusions     When two related quantities are changing in tandem, we can better understand how change in one affects the other by using data, graphs, words, or algebraic symbols to express the relationship between them. See, for instance, Table , Figure , , and Equation that together help explain how the height and volume of water in a conical tank change in tandem as time changes.    When the amount of water in a tank is changing, we can observe other quantities that change, depending on the shape of the tank. For instance, if the tank is conical, we can consider both the changing height of the water and the changing radius of the surface of the water. In addition, whenever we think about a quantity that is changing as time passes, we note that time itself is changing.        "

  "title": "Functions and Notation",
  "body": " Functions and Notation   What is a Function?  The natural world is full of relationships between quantities that change. When we see these relationships, it is natural for us to ask, ”If I know one quantity, can I then determine the other?” This establishes the idea of an input quantity, or independent variable, and a corresponding output quantity, or dependent variable. From this we get the notion of a functional relationship in which the output can be determined from the input.  For some quantities, like height and age, there are certainly relationships between these quantities. Given a specific person and any age, it is easy enough to determine their height, but if we tried to reverse that relationship and determine age from a given height, that would be problematic, since most people maintain the same height for many years.   Function   A rule for a relationship between an input, or independent, quantity and an output, or dependent, quantity in which each input value uniquely determines one output value. We say, “the output is a function of the input.”      In the height and age example above, is height a function of age? Is age a function of height?  In the height and age example above, it would be correct to say that height is a function of age, since each age uniquely determines a height. For example, on my 18th birthday, I had exactly one height of 69 inches.  However, age is not a function of height, since one height input might correspond with more than one output age. For example, for an input height of 70 inches, there is more than one output of age since I was 70 inches at the age of 20 and 21.      At a coffee shop, the menu consists of items and their prices. Is price a function of the item? Is the item a function of the price?  We could say that price is a function of the item, since each input of an item has one output of a price corresponding to it. We could not say that item is a function of price, since two items might have the same price.      In many classes the overall percentage you earn in the course corresponds to a decimal grade point. Is decimal grade a function of percentage? Is percentage a function of decimal grade?  For any percentage earned, there would be a decimal grade associated, so we could say that the decimal grade is a function of percentage. That is, if you input the percentage, your output would be a decimal grade. Percentage may or may not be a function of decimal grade, depending upon the teacher’s grading scheme. With some grading systems, there are a range of percentages that correspond to the same decimal grade.     One-to-One Function   Sometimes in a relationship each input corresponds to exactly one output, and every output corresponds to exactly one input. We call this kind of relationship a one-to-one function.    From Example 3, if each unique percentage corresponds to one unique decimal grade point and each unique decimal grade point corresponds to one unique percentage then it is a one-to-one function.   Let’s consider bank account information.  Is your balance a function of your bank account number? (If you input a bank account number does it make sense that the output is your balance?)      Is your bank account number a function of your balance? (if you input a balance does it make sense that the output is your bank account number?)     Function Notation  To simplify writing out expressions and equations involving functions, a simplified notation is often used. We also use descriptive variables to help us remember the meaning of the quantities in the problem.  Rather than write ”height is a function of age”, we could use the descriptive variable to represent height and we could use the descriptive variable to represent age.  “Height is a function of age”, then if we name the function we can write  “ is of ” or more simply   .  Be careful - the parentheses indicate that age is input into the function (Note: do not confuse these parentheses with multiplication! It does not mean “ times ”).   Function Notation   The notation defines a function named . This would be read “output is of input”      Introduce function notation to represent a function that takes as input the name of a month and gives as output the number of days in that month.  The number of days in a month is a function of the name of the month, so if we name the function , we could write “ ” or .  For example, , since March has 31 days. The notation reminds us that the number of days, (the output) is dependent on the name of the month, (the input)      A function gives the number of police officers, , in a town in year . What does tell us?  When we read , we see the input quantity is 2005, which is a value for the input quantity of the function, the year ( ). The output value is 300, the number of police officers ( ), a value for the output quantity. Remember . This tells us that in the year 2005 there were 300 police officers in the town.      Tables as Functions  Functions can be represented in many ways: Words (as we did in the last few examples), tables of values, graphs, or formulas. Represented as a table, we are presented with a list of input and output values.  In some cases, these values represent everything we know about the relationship, while in other cases the table is simply providing us a few select values from a more complete relationship.  Table 1: This table represents the input, number of the month (January = 1, February = 2, and so on) while the output is the number of days in that month. This represents everything we know about the months and days for a given year (that is not a leap year)                                (input) Month number,   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12    (output) Days in month,   31  28  31  30  31  30  31  31  30  31  30  31    Table 2: The table below defines a function . Remember this notation tells us is the name of the function that takes the input and gives the output .                   1  2  3  4  5       8  6  7  6  8    Table 3: This table represents the age of children in years and their corresponding heights. This represents just some of the data available for height and ages of children.                    (input) , age in years  5  5  6  7  8  9  10    (output) , height inches  40  42  44  47  50  52  54      Which of these tables define a function (if any)? Are any of them one-to-one?        Input  Output    2  1    5  3    8  6          Input  Output    -3  5    0  1    4  5          Input  Output    1  0    5  2    5  4    The first and second tables define functions. In both, each input corresponds to exactly one output. The third table does not define a function since the input value of 5 corresponds with two different output values.  Only the first table is one-to-one; it is both a function, and each output corresponds to exactly one input. Although table 2 is a function, because each input corresponds to exactly one output, each output does not correspond to exactly one input so this function is not one-to-one. Table 3 is not even a function and so we don’t even need to consider if it is a one-to-one function.     If each percentage earned translated to one letter grade, would this be a function? Is it one-to-one?     Solving and Evaluating Functions  When we work with functions, there are two typical things we do: evaluate and solve. Evaluating a function is what we do when we know an input, and use the function to determine the corresponding output. Evaluating will always produce one result, since each input of a function corresponds to exactly one output. When we have a formula for the function we are evaluating, we always want to make sure we are performing operations in the correct order, commonly known as the “Order of Operations”. You have likely heard of or seen the order of operations in a previous class: Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiply, Divide, Addition, Subtraction. We also need to remember that sometimes these steps are nested within each other. For example, in the function , if I wanted to evaluate , I would need to first simplify the terms inside of the parenthesis, and I would need to follow proper order of operations INSIDE of the parenthesis. So, I would evaluate first, then move outside our parenthesis to simplify .  Solving equations involving a function is what we do when we know an output and use the function to determine the inputs that would produce that output. Solving a function could produce more than one solution, since different inputs can produce the same output. Since solving an equation is the “opposite” of evaluating an equation, it can be helpful to think of using the “opposite” order of operations. For example, using our function from above, if we wanted to solve , we would need to find the value of that makes the equation true. Since our goal is to get by itself, we can follow the reverse order of operations to isolate . First, we subtract the 9 to get , then divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get . Now that we are inside of the parenthesis we can repeat the process by adding 3 and then dividing both sides by 5 to get our solution of .    Using the table shown, where :                   1  2  3  4  5       8  6  7  6  8    a) Evaluate   Evaluating (read: “ of 3”) means that we need to determine the output value, , of the function given the input value of . Looking at the table, we see the output corresponding to is , allowing us to conclude .  b) Solve   Solving means we need to determine what input values, , produce an output value of 6. Looking at the table we see there are two solutions: and .  When we input 2 into the function , our output is   When we input 4 into the function , our output is also      Using the function in Example 7, evaluate .     Graphs as Functions  Oftentimes a graph of a relationship can be used to define a function. By convention, graphs are typically created with the input quantity along the horizontal axis and the output quantity along the vertical.  The most common graph has y on the vertical axis and x on the horizontal axis, and we say y is a function of x, or y = f(x) when the function is named f.   The xy coordinate plane.    A coordinate plane grid with the horizontal axis labeled with the variable x and the vertical axis labeled with the variable y.       Which of these graphs defines a function ? Which of these graphs defines a one-to-one function?   Graph 1    Graph of a smooth curve that increases to negative 1 comma 3, decreases to 1 comma negative 3, then increases.      Graph 2    Graph of a decreasing straight line.      Graph 3    Graph of a circle with radius 3 centered at the origin.     Looking at the three graphs above, the first two define a function , since for each input value along the horizontal axis there is exactly one output value corresponding, determined by the -value of the graph. The 3rd graph does not define a function since some input values, such as , correspond with more than one output value.  Graph 1 is not a one-to-one function. For example, the output value 3 has two corresponding input values, -1 and 2.3  Graph 2 is a one-to-one function; each input corresponds to exactly one output, and every output corresponds to exactly one input.  Graph 3 is not even a function so there is no reason to even check to see if it is a one-to-one function.     Vertical line test   The vertical line test is a handy way to think about whether a graph defines the vertical output as a function of the horizontal input. Imagine drawing vertical lines through the graph. If any vertical line would cross the graph more than once, then the graph does not define only one vertical output for each horizontal input.     Horizontal Line Test   Once you have determined that a graph defines a function, an easy way to determine if it is a one-to-one function is to use the horizontal line test. Draw horizontal lines through the graph. If any horizontal line crosses the graph more than once, then the graph does not define a one-to-one function.    Evaluating a function using a graph requires taking the given input and using the graph to look up the corresponding output. Solving a function equation using a graph requires taking the given output and looking on the graph to determine the corresponding input.    Given the graph of f(x),  a) Evaluate   b) Solve    Graph of    A U-shaped graph passing through negative 1 comma 4, 0 comma 1, 1 comma 0, 2 comma 1, and 3 comma 4.     a) To evaluate , we find the input of on the horizontal axis. Moving up to the graph gives the point , giving an output of . .  b) To solve , we find the value 4 on the vertical axis because if then 4 is the output. Moving horizontally across the graph gives two points with the output of 4: and . These give the two solutions to : or .  This means and , or when the input is -1 or 3, the output is 4.    Notice that while the graph in the previous example is a function, getting two input values for the output value of 4 shows us that this function is not one-to-one.   Using the graph from example 9, solve .     Formulas as Functions  When possible, it is very convenient to define relationships using formulas. If it is possible to express the output as a formula involving the input quantity, then we can define a function.    Express the relationship as a function if possible.  To express the relationship in this form, we need to be able to write the relationship where is a function of , which means writing it as = [something involving ].  Starting with the given equation, we can then subtract from both sides to get and then we can divide both sides by 6 and simplify to find   Having rewritten the formula as =, we can now express p as a function:     It is important to note that not every relationship can be expressed as a function with a formula.  Note the important feature of an equation written as a function is that the output value can be determined directly from the input by doing evaluations - no further solving is required. This allows the relationship to act as a machine that takes an input, processes it, and returns an output. Modern technology and computers rely on these functional relationships, since the evaluation of the function can be programmed into machines, whereas solving things is much more challenging.    Express the relationship as a function if possible.  If we try to solve for in this equation, we get        We end up with two outputs corresponding to the same input, so this relationship cannot be represented as a single function .    As with tables and graphs, it is common to evaluate and solve functions involving formulas. Evaluating will require replacing the input variable in the formula with the value provided and calculating. Solving will require replacing the output variable in the formula with the value provided and solving for the input(s) that would produce that output.    Given the function ,  a) Evaluate   b) Solve   a) “Evaluate ” means we want to find the output when the input is . We plug in the input value 2 into the formula wherever we see the input variable , then simplify     b) “Solve ” means we want to find the input that will give us an output of 1. We set the formula for equal to 1, and solve for the input. Starting with the given information: we can then substitute the original formula to get Then subtract 2 from each side to get and finally take the cube root of each side to get the solution   When solving an equation using formulas, you can check your answer by using your solution in the original equation to see if your calculated answer is correct.  We want to know if is true when . , which was the desired result.      Given the function ,  a) Evaluate   b) Solve   To evaluate we substitute the value 4 for the input variable in the given function. a)   b) Starting with , we substitute the original function to get This is quadratic, so we can rearrange the equation to get something equal to 0 by subtracting 3 from each side. So, This is factor-able, so we factor it By the zero-factor theorem since , either or (or both equal 0) and so we solve both equations for , finding from the first equation and from the second equation.  This gives us the solution: when or   We found two solutions in this case, which tells us this function is not one-to-one.     Given the function , a. Evaluate b. Solve      Basic Toolkit Functions  In this text, we will be exploring functions – the shapes of their graphs, their unique features, their equations, and how to solve problems with them. When learning to read, we start with the alphabet. When learning to do arithmetic, we start with numbers. When working with functions, it is similarly helpful to have a base set of elements to build from. We call these our ”toolkit of functions” – a set of basic named functions for which we know the graph, equation, and special features.  For these definitions we will use as the input variable and as the function output.   Toolkit Functions   .   Linear   Constant: where is a constant number    Identity:        Absolute Value:     Power   Quadratic:     Cubic:     Reciprocal:     Reciprocal Squared:     Square Root:     Cube Root:           You will see these toolkit functions, combinations of toolkit functions, their graphs and their transformations frequently throughout this book. In order to successfully follow along later in the book, it will be very helpful if you can recognize these toolkit functions and their features quickly by name, equation, graph and basic table values.  Not every important equation can be written as . An example of this is the equation of a circle. Recall the distance formula for the distance between two points: A circle with radius with center at can be described as all points a distance of from the center, so using the distance formula, , giving:   Equation of a circle   A circle with radius r with center has equation .      Graphs of the Toolkit Functions  The following graphs are the graphs of the toolkit functions, followed by the function definition.   Graph of the constant function    A horizontal line passing through the points negative 4 comma 2, negative 2 comma 2, 0 comma 2, 2 comma 2, and 4 comma 2.

When we identify limitations on the inputs and outputs of a function, we are determining the domain and range of the function.   Domain and Range   Domain: The set of possible or acceptable input values to a function Range: The set of possible or acceptable output values of a function      Using the tree table above, determine a reasonable domain and range.  We could combine the data provided with our own experiences and reason to approximate the domain and range of the function . For the domain, possible values for the input circumference , it doesn’t make sense to have negative values, so . We could make an educated guess at a maximum reasonable value, or look up that the maximum circumference measured is about 119 feet . With this information, we would say a reasonable domain is feet.  Similarly for the range, it doesn’t make sense to have negative heights, and the maximum height of a tree could be looked up to be 379 feet, so a reasonable range is feet.      When sending a letter through the United States Postal Service, the price depends upon the weight of the letter, as shown in the table below. Determine the domain and range.   Letter Prices        Weight not over  Price    1 ounce  $0.58    2 ounces  $0.78    3 ounces  $0.98    3.5 ounces  $1.18     Suppose we notate Weight by and Price by , and set up a function named , where Price, is a function of Weight, . .  Since acceptable weights are 3.5 ounces or less, and negative weights don’t make sense, the domain would be . Technically 0 could be included in the domain, but logically it would mean we are mailing nothing, so it doesn’t hurt to leave it out.  Since possible prices are from a limited set of values, we can only define the range of this function by listing the possible values. The range is = $0.58, $0.78, $0.98, or $1.18.     The population of a small town in the year 1960 was 100 people. Since then, the population has grown to 1400 people reported during the 2010 census. Choose descriptive variables for your input and output and use interval notation to write the domain and range.     Notation  In the previous examples, we used inequalities to describe the domain and range of the functions. This is one way to describe intervals of input and output values, but is not the only way. Let us take a moment to discuss notation for domain and range.  Using inequalities, such as , , and imply that we are interested in all values between the low and high values, including the high values in these examples.  However, occasionally we are interested in a specific list of numbers like the range for the price to send letters, = $0.58, $0.78, $0.98, or $1.18. These numbers represent a set of specific values: .  Representing values as a set, or giving instructions on how a set is built, leads us to another type of notation to describe the domain and range.  Suppose we want to describe the values for a variable that are 10 or greater, but less than 30. In inequalities, we would write .  When describing domains and ranges, we sometimes extend this into set-builder notation, which would look like this: . The curly brackets {} are read as “the set of”, and the vertical bar | is read as “such that”, so altogether we would read as “the set of -values such that 10 is less than or equal to and is less than 30.”  When describing ranges in set-builder notation, we could similarly write something like , or if the output had its own variable, we could use it. So for our tree height example above, we could write for the range . In set-builder notation, if a domain or range is not limited, we could write , or , read as “the set of -values such that is an element of the set of real numbers.  A more compact alternative to set-builder notation is interval notation, in which intervals of values are referred to by the starting and ending values. Curved parentheses are used for “strictly less than,” and square brackets are used for “less than or equal to.” Since infinity is not a number, we can’t include it in the interval, so we always use curved parentheses with and . The table below will help you see how inequalities correspond to set-builder notation and interval notation:          Inequality  Set Builder Notation  Interval Notation                                                           all real numbers          To combine two intervals together, using inequalities or set-builder notation we can use the word “or”. In interval notation, we use the union symbol, , to combine two unconnected intervals together.    Describe the intervals of values shown on the line graph below using set builder and interval notations.     A number line from -2 to 7 with two shaded sections. There are closed dots at 1 and 3 with the number line between shaded. There is an open dot at 5 with the number line shaded to the right.     To describe the values, , that lie in the intervals shown above we would say, “ is a real number greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3, or a real number greater than 5.”  As an inequality it is: or In set builder notation: In interval notation:     Remember when writing or reading interval notation: Using a square bracket [ means the start value is included in the set Using a parenthesis ( means the start value is not included in the set   Given the following interval, write its meaning in words, set builder notation, and interval notation.     A number line from -5 to 5 with two shaded sections. There is a closed dot at -2 with the number line to the left shaded. There is a closed dot at -1 and open dot at 3 with the number line between shaded.        Domain and Range from Graphs  We can also talk about domain and range based on graphs. Since domain refers to the set of possible input values, the domain of a graph consists of all the input values shown on the graph. Remember that input values are almost always shown along the horizontal axis of the graph. Likewise, since range is the set of possible output values, the range of a graph we can see from the possible values along the vertical axis of the graph.  Be careful – if the graph continues beyond the window on which we can see the graph, the domain and range might be larger than the values we can see.    Determine the domain and range of the graph below.     A graph labeled Alaska Crude Oil Production in thousands of barrels per day, with the horizontal axis showing years from 1975 to 2008, and the vertical axis from 0 to 2200. The graph starts in 1975 around 200, drops a little to about 180, increases up to about 2010 in 1988, then drops to about 700 in 2008.     In the graph above, the input quantity along the horizontal axis appears to be “year”, which we could notate with the variable . The output is “thousands of barrels of oil per day”, which we might notate with the variable , for barrels. The graph would likely continue to the left and right beyond what is shown, but based on the portion of the graph that is shown to us, we can determine the domain is , and the range is approximately .  In interval notation, the domain would be and the range would be about . For the range, we have to approximate the smallest and largest outputs since they don’t fall exactly on the grid lines.    Remember that, as in the previous example, and are not always the input and output variables. Using descriptive variables is an important tool to remembering the context of the problem.   Given the graph below write the domain and range in interval notation     A graph labeled World Population Increase. The vertical axis is labeled population increase in millions, and the horizontal axis is in years. The graph starts around 45 in 1952, increases for a while, then drops to 40 in 1960. It increases and decreases a bit, reaching a high of 88 in 1989. The graph ends at 76 in 2002.        Domains and Ranges of the Toolkit functions  We will now return to our set of toolkit functions to note the domain and range of each.    Constant Function:   The domain here is not restricted; can be anything. When this is the case, we say the domain is all real numbers. The outputs are limited to the constant value of the function.   Domain:     Range:   Since there is only one output value, we list it by itself in square brackets.       Identity Function:    Domain:     Range:        Quadratic Function:    Domain:     Range:   Multiplying a negative or positive number by itself can only yield a positive output.       Cubic Function:    Domain:     Range:        Reciprocal:    Domain:   We cannot divide by 0 so we must exclude 0 from the domain.    Range:   One divided by any value can never be 0, so the range will not include 0.       Reciprocal squared:    Domain:   We cannot divide by 0 so we must exclude 0 from the domain.    Range:   Since the denominator will always be positive, and 1 divided by a positive number will be positive, the range will always be positive.       Cube Root:    Domain:     Range:        Square Root:    Domain:   When dealing with the set of real numbers we cannot take the square root of a negative number so the domain is limited to 0 or greater.    Range:        Absolute Value Function:    Domain:     Range:   Since absolute value is defined as a distance from 0, the output can only be greater than or equal to 0.         Find the domain of each function:  a)   b)   a) Since we cannot take the square root of a negative number, we need the inside of the square root to be non-negative. when .

  "title": "Rates of Change",
  "body": " Rates of Change   Definitions  Since functions represent how an output quantity varies with an input quantity, it is natural to ask about the rate at which the values of the function are changing.  For example, the function below gives the average cost , in dollars, of a gallon of gasoline years after 2000.                         2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9       1.47  1.69  1.94  2.30  2.51  2.64  3.01  2.14    If we were interested in how the gas prices had changed between 2002 and 2009, we could compute that the cost per gallon had increased from $1.47 to $2.14, an increase of $0.67. While this is interesting, it might be more useful to look at how much the price changed per year. You are probably noticing that the price didn’t change the same amount each year, so we would be finding the average rate of change over a specified amount of time.  The gas price increased by $0.67 from 2002 to 2009, over 7 years, for an average of $0.67\/7 years $0.096 per year. On average, the price of gas increased by about 9.6 cents each year.   Rate of Change   A rate of change describes how the output quantity changes in relation to the input quantity. The units on a rate of change are “output units per input unit” or ” ”.    Some other examples of rates of change would be quantities like:    A population of rats increases by 40 rats per week.    A barista earns $9 per hour (dollars per hour).    A farmer plants 60,000 onions per acre.    A car can drive 27 miles per gallon of gasoline.    A population of grey whales decreases by 8 whales per year.    The amount of money in your college account decreases by $8,000 per semester.     Average Rate of Change   The average rate of change between two input values is the total change of the function values (output values) divided by the change in the input values. If we are given two pairs of input and output values and , then we compute the average rate of change from the first point to the second point with the following calculation:       Using the cost-of-gas function from earlier, find the average rate of change between 2007 and 2009  From the table, in 2007 the cost of gas was $2.64. In 2009 the cost was $2.14.  The input (years) has changed by 2. The output has changed by $2.14 - $2.64 = -$0.50. The average rate of change is then dollars per year.     Using the same cost-of-gas function, find the average rate of change between 2003 and 2008.   Notice that in the last example the change of output was negative since the output value of the function had decreased. Correspondingly, the average rate of change is negative.    Given the function g(t) shown here, find the average rate of change on the interval .     A U-shaped graph passing through 0 comma 1, 1 comma 0, 2 comma 1, and 3 comma 4     At , the graph shows . At , the graph shows .  The output has changed by 3 while the input has changed by 3, giving an average rate of change of:       On a road trip, after picking up your friend who lives 10 miles away, you decide to record your distance from home over time. Find your average speed over the first 6 hours.

You traveled 282 miles in 6 hours, for an average speed of miles per hour.    We can more formally state the average rate of change calculation using function notation.   Average Rate of Change using Function Notation   Given a function , the average rate of change on the interval is       Compute the average rate of change of on the interval .  We can start by computing the function values at each endpoint of the interval   ,   .  Now computing the average rate of change      Find the average rate of change of on the interval .     The magnetic force , measured in Newtons, between two magnets is related to the distance between the magnets , in centimeters, by the formula . Find the average rate of change of force if the distance between the magnets is increased from 2 cm to 6 cm.  We are computing the average rate of change of on the interval .   Evaluating the function, we get:     This tells us the magnetic force decreases, on average, by Newtons per centimeter over this interval.      Find the average rate of change of on the interval . Your answer will be an expression involving .  Using the average rate of change formula   This result tells us the average rate of change between and any other point . For example, on the interval , the average rate of change would be .     Find the average rate of change of on the interval .     Graphical Behavior of Functions  As part of exploring how functions change, it is interesting to explore the graphical behavior of functions.   Increasing\/Decreasing   A function is increasing on an interval if the function values increase as the inputs increase. More formally, a function is increasing if for any two input values and in the interval with . The average rate of change of an increasing function is positive.  A function is decreasing on an interval if the function values decrease as the inputs increase. More formally, a function is decreasing if for any two input values and in the interval with . The average rate of change of a decreasing function is negative.      Given the function p(t) graphed here, on what intervals does the function appear to be increasing?     A graph passing through the points 0 comma 3, 1 comma negative 1, 3 comma 1, 4 comma 0.7 and 5 comma 3.5     The function appears to be increasing from to , and from on.  In interval notation, we would say the function appears to be increasing on the interval and the interval , or .    Notice in the last example that we used open intervals (intervals that don’t include the endpoints) since the function is neither increasing nor decreasing at .

  "body": " Composition   Definitions  Suppose we wanted to calculate how much it costs to heat a house on a particular day of the year. The cost to heat a house will depend on the average daily temperature, and the average daily temperature depends on the particular day of the year. Notice how we have just defined two relationships: The temperature depends on the day, and the cost depends on the temperature. Using descriptive variables, we can notate these two functions.  The first function, , gives the cost of heating a house when the average daily temperature is degrees Celsius, and the second, , gives the average daily temperature on day of the year in some city. If we wanted to determine the cost of heating the house on the 5th day of the year, we could do this by linking our two functions together, an idea called composition of functions. Using the function , we could evaluate to determine the average daily temperature on the 5th day of the year. We could then use that temperature as the input to the function to find the cost to heat the house on the 5th day of the year: .   Composition of Functions   When the output of one function is used as the input of another, we call the entire operation a composition of functions. We write and read this as “ of of ” or “ composed with at ”.  An alternate notation for composition uses the composition operator:    is read “ of of ” or “ composed with at ”, just like . We could refer to the name of this new function as .      Suppose gives the number of calories burned doing sit-ups, and gives the number of sit-ups a person can do in minutes. Interpret .  When we are asked to interpret, we are being asked to explain the meaning of the expression in words. The inside expression in the composition is . Since the input to the function is time, the 3 is representing 3 minutes, and is the number of sit-ups that can be done in 3 minutes. Taking this output and using it as the input to the function will gives us the calories that can be burned by the number of sit-ups that can be done in 3 minutes.    Note that it is no context involved in the scenario, it is not important that the same variable be used for the output of the inside function and the input to the outside function. However, it is essential that if we are given context, then the units on the output of the inside function match the units on the input to the outside function if the units are specified.    Suppose gives miles that can be driven in hours, and gives the gallons of gas used in driving miles. Which of these expressions is meaningful: or ?  The expression takes miles as the input and outputs a number of gallons. The function is expecting a number of hours as the input; trying to give it a number of gallons as input does not make sense. Remember the units must match, and number of gallons does not match number of hours, so the expression is meaningless.  The expression takes hours as input and outputs a number of miles driven. The function is expecting a number of miles as the input, so giving the output of the function (miles driven) as an input value for , where gallons of gas depend on miles driven, does make sense. The expression makes sense and will give the number of gallons of gas used, driving a certain number of miles, , in hours.     In a department store you see a sign that says 50%off clearance merchandise, so final cost C depends on the clearance price, p, according to the function j(p). Clearance price, p, depends on the original discount, d, given to the clearance item, k(d). Interpret j(k(d)).     Composition of Functions using Tables and Graphs  When working with functions given as tables and graphs, we can look up values for the functions using a provided table or graph, as discussed in section 1.2. We start evaluation from the provided input, and first evaluate the inside function. We can then use the output of the inside function as the input to the outside function. To remember this, always work from the inside out, as if we are following the order of operations.    Using the tables below, evaluate and .                1  6    2  8    3  3    4  1                  1  3    2  5    3  2    4  7    To evaluate , we start from the inside with the value 3. We then evaluate the inside expression using the table that defines the function : . We can then use that result as the input to the function, so is replaced by the equivalent value 2 and we can evaluate . Then using the table that defines the function , we find that . Thus, .  To evaluate , we first evaluate the inside expression using the first table: . Then using the table for , we can evaluate: .     Using the tables from the example above, evaluate and .     Using the graphs below, evaluate .   Graph of    Graph of f(x), a downward-opening U-shaped graph which passes through 1 comma 2, 2 comma 5, 3 comma 6, 4 comma 5, and 5 comma 2      Graph of    Graph of g(x), an upward-opening U-shaped graph which passes through 1 comma 3, 2 comma 0, 3 comma negative 1, 4 comma 0, and 5 comma 3     To evaluate , we again start with the inside evaluation. We evaluate using the graph of the function, finding the input of 1 on the horizontal axis and finding the output value of the graph at that input. Here, .  Using this value as the input to the function, . We can then evaluate this by looking to the graph of the function, finding the input of 3 on the horizontal axis, and reading the output value of the graph at this input.   , so .     Using the graphs from the previous example, evaluate .     Composition using Formulas  When evaluating a composition of functions where we have either created or been given formulas, the concept of working from the inside out remains the same. First, we evaluate the inside function using the input value provided, then use the resulting output as the input to the outside function.    Given and , evaluate .  Since the inside evaluation is , we start by evaluating the function at 1:     Then , so we evaluate the function at an input of 5:   .     Using the functions from the example above, evaluate .   While we can compose the functions as above for each individual input value, sometimes it would be really helpful to find a single formula which will calculate the result of a composition . To do this, we will extend our idea of function evaluation. Recall that when we evaluate a function like , we put whatever value is inside the parentheses after the function name into the formula wherever we see the input variable.    Given , evaluate and .        We could simplify the results above if we wanted to          We are not limited, however, to using a numerical value as the input to the function. We can put anything into the function: a value, a different variable, or even an algebraic expression, provided we use the input expression everywhere we see the input variable.    Using the function from the previous example, evaluate .  This means that the input value for is some unknown quantity . As before, we evaluate by replacing the input variable with the input quantity, in this case .       The same idea can then be applied to expressions more complicated than a single letter.    Using the same function from above, evaluate .  Everywhere in the formula for where there was a , we would replace it with the input . Since in the original formula the input was squared in the first term, the entire input needs to be squared when we substitute, so we need to use grouping parentheses. To avoid problems, it is advisable to always use parentheses around inputs.     We could simplify this expression further to if we wanted to:     Use the “FOIL” technique (first, outside, inside, last)     distribute the negative sign     combine like terms   .      Using the same function, evaluate .  We replace the original input in the formula with the new input expression, .   .     Given , evaluate .   This now allows us to find an expression for a composition of functions. If we want to find a formula for , we can start by writing out the formula for . We can then evaluate the function at that expression, as in the examples above.    Let and , find and .  To find , we start by evaluating the inside, writing out the formula for .     We then use the expression as input for the function .     We then evaluate the function using the formula for as the input.  Since ,   This gives us the formula for the composition: .  Likewise, to find , we evaluate the inside, writing out the formula for :     Now we evaluate the function using as the input.        Let and , find and .     A city manager determines that the tax revenue, , in millions of dollars collected on a population of thousand people is given by the formula , and that the city’s population, in thousands, is predicted to follow the formula , where is measured in years after 2010. Find a formula for the tax revenue as a function of the year.  Since we want tax revenue as a function of the year, we want year to be our initial input, and revenue to be our final output. To find revenue, we will first have to predict the city population, and then use that result as the input to the tax function. So, we need to find . Evaluating this,     This composition gives us a single formula which can be used to predict the tax revenue during a given year, without needing to find the intermediary population value.  For example, to predict the tax revenue in 2017, when (because is measured in years after 2010),   million dollars      Domain of Compositions  When we think about the domain of a composition , we must consider both the domain of the inner function and the domain of the composition itself. While it is tempting to only look at the resulting composite function, if the inner function were undefined at a value of , the composition would not be possible.    Let and . Find the domain of .  Since we want to avoid the square root of negative numbers, the domain of is the set of values where . The domain is .  The composition is . The composition is undefined when , so that value must also be excluded from the domain. Notice that the composition doesn’t involve a square root, but we still have to consider the domain limitation from the inside function. Combining the two restrictions, the domain is all values of greater than or equal to 2, except .  In inequalities, the domain is: or . In interval notation, the domain is: .     Let and . Find the domain of .     Decomposing Functions  In some cases, it is desirable to decompose a function – to write it as a composition of two simpler functions.   Write as the composition of two functions.  We are looking for two functions, and , so . To do this, we look for a function inside a function in the formula for . As one possibility, we might notice that is the inside of the square root. We could then decompose the function as:        We can check our answer by recomposing the functions:   Note that this is not the only solution to the problem. Another non-trivial decomposition would be and .

  "body": " Transformations  Often when given a problem, we try to model the scenario using mathematics in the form of words, tables, graphs, and equations in order to explain or solve it. When building models, it is often helpful to build from existing formulas or models. Knowing the basic graphs of your tool-kit functions can help you solve problems by being able to model new behavior by adapting something you already know. Unfortunately, the models and existing formulas we know are not always the same as the ones presented in the problems we face.  Fortunately, there are systematic ways to shift, stretch, compress, flip and combine functions to help them become better models for the problems we are trying to solve. We can transform what we already know into what we need, hence the name, “Transformation of functions.” When we have a story problem, formula, graph, or table, we can then transform that function in a variety of ways to form new functions.   Shifts    To regulate temperature in a green building, air flow vents near the roof open and close throughout the day to allow warm air to escape. The graph below shows the open vents (in square feet) throughout the day, in hours after midnight. During the summer, the facilities staff decides to try to better regulate temperature by increasing the amount of open vents by 20 square feet throughout the day. Sketch a graph of this new function.   Graph of    Graph of V(t), which is 0 from t=0 to t=8, then increases to 10 comma 225, remains constant to 17 comma 225, decreases to 19 comma 0 then stays constant at 0 until t=24     We can sketch a graph of this new function by adding 20 to each of the output values of the original function. This will have the effect of shifting the graph up.   Graph of    Graph of S(t), which is 20 from t=0 to t=8, then increases to 10 comma 245, remains constant to 17 comma 245, decreases to 19 comma 20 then stays constant at 20 until t=24     Notice that in the second graph, for each input value, the output value has increased by twenty, so if we call the new function , we could write .  Note that this notation tells us that for any value of , can be found by evaluating the function at the same input, then adding twenty to the result. This defines as a transformation of the function , in this case a vertical shift up 20 units.  Notice that with a vertical shift the input values stay the same and only the output values change.     Vertical Shift   Given a function , if we define a new function as , where is a constant, then is a vertical shift of the function , where all the output values have been increased by . If is positive, then the graph will shift up by units. If is negative, then the graph will shift down by units.      A function is given as a table below. Create a table for the function .                 2  4  6  8       1  3  7  11    The formula tells us that we can find the output values of the function by subtracting 3 from the output values of the function. For example, is found from the given table. is our given transformation, so . Subtracting 3 from each value, we can complete a table of values for ,                 2  4  6  8       -2  0  4  8      As with the earlier vertical shift, notice the input values stay the same and only the output values change.   The function gives the height of a ball (in meters) thrown upwards from the ground after seconds. Suppose the ball was instead thrown from the top of a 10-meter building. Relate this new height function to , then find a formula for .   The vertical shift is a change to the output, or outside, of the function. We will now look at how changes to input, on the inside of the function, change its graph and meaning.    Returning to our building air flow example from the beginning of the section, suppose that in Fall, the facilities staff decides that the original venting plan starts too late, and they want to move the entire venting program to start two hours earlier. Sketch a graph of the new function.   the original venting plan    Graph of V(t), which is 0 from t=0 to t=8, then increases to 10 comma 225, remains constant to 17 comma 225, decreases to 19 comma 0 then stays constant at 0 until t=24      starting 2 hours sooner    Graph of F(t), which is 0 from t=negative 2 to t=6, then increases to 8 comma 225, remains constant to 15 comma 225, decreases to 17 comma 0 then stays constant at 0 until t=22     In the new graph, which we can call , at each time, the air flow is the same as the original function was two hours later. For example, in the original function , the air flow starts to change at 8 am, while for the function the air flow starts to change at 6 am. The comparable function values are .  Notice also that the vents first opened to 220 sq. ft. at 10 am under the original plan, while under the new plan the vents reach 220 sq. ft. at 8 am, so .  In both cases we see that since starts 2 hours sooner, the same output values are reached when, .  Note that had the effect of shifting the graph to the left.    Horizontal changes or “inside changes” affect the domain of a function (the input) instead of the range and often seem counterintuitive. The new function uses the same outputs as but matches those outputs to inputs two hours earlier than those of . Said another way, we must add 2 hours to the input of to find the corresponding output for : .   Horizontal Shift   Given a function , if we define a new function as , where is a constant, then is a horizontal shift of the function . If is positive, then the graph will shift left by units. If is negative, then the graph will shift right by units.      A function is given as a table below. Create a table for the function .                 2  4  6  8       1  3  7  11    The formula tells us that the output values of are the same as the output value of with an input value three smaller. For example, we know that . To get the same output from the function, we will need an input value that is 3 larger: We input a value that is three larger for because the function takes three away before evaluating the function .                    5  7  9  11       1  3  7  11    The result is that the function has been shifted to the right by 3. Notice the output values for remain the same as the output values for in the chart, but the corresponding input values, , have shifted to the right by 3: 2 shifted to 5, 4 shifted to 7, 6 shifted to 9 and 8 shifted to 11.      The graph shown is a transformation of the toolkit function . Relate this new function to , and then find a formula for .   Graph of    U-shaped graph that decreases to 2 comma 0 then increases     Notice that the graph looks almost identical in shape to the function, but the values are shifted to the right two units. The vertex used to be at but now the vertex is at . The graph is the basic quadratic function shifted two to the right, so .  Notice how we must input the value , to get the output value ; the values must be two units larger, because of the shift to the right by 2 units.  We can then use the definition of the function to write a formula for by evaluating : Since and . Thus, .  If you find yourself having trouble determining whether the shift is +2 or -2, it might help to consider a single point on the graph. For a quadratic, looking at the bottom-most point is convenient. In the original function, . In our shifted function, . To obtain the output value of 0 from the function, we need to decide whether a +2 or -2 will work to satisfy . For this to work, we will need to subtract 2 from our input values.    When thinking about horizontal and vertical shifts, it is good to keep in mind that vertical shifts are affecting the output values of the function, while horizontal shifts are affecting the input values of the function.    The function gives the number of gallons of gas required to drive miles. Interpret and .   is adding 10 to the output, gallons. This is 10 gallons of gas more than is required to drive miles. So, this is the gas required to drive miles, plus another 10 gallons of gas.   is adding 10 to the input, miles. This is the number of gallons of gas required to drive 10 miles more than miles.     Given the function graph the original function and the transformation .   Is this a horizontal or a vertical change?    Which way is the graph shifted and by how many units?    Graph and on the same axes.      Now that we have two transformations, we can combine them together.  Remember:    Vertical Shifts are outside changes that affect the output (vertical) axis values shifting the transformed function up or down.    Horizontal Shifts are inside changes that affect the input (horizontal) axis values shifting the transformed function left or right.      Given , sketch a graph of .  The function is our toolkit absolute value function. We know that this graph has a V-shape, with the point at the origin. The graph of has transformed in two ways: is a change on the inside of the function, giving a horizontal shift left by 1, then the subtraction by 3 in is a change to the outside of the function, giving a vertical shift down by 3. Transforming the graph gives:   Graph of    V-shaped graph that decreases to negative 2 comma negative 3 then increases, passing through 0 comma negative 2     We could also find a formula for this transformation by evaluating the expression for : .      Write a formula for the graph shown, which is a transformation of the toolkit square root function.   Graph of    A square root graph with initial point at 1 comma 2, increasing to the right     The graph of the toolkit function starts at the origin, so this graph has been shifted 1 to the right, and up 2. In function notation, we could write that as . Using the formula for the square root function we can write .  Note that this transformation has changed the domain and range of the function. This new graph has domain and range .      Reflections  Another transformation that can be applied to a function is a reflection over the horizontal or vertical axis.    Reflect the graph of both vertically and horizontally.  Reflecting the graph vertically, each output value will be reflected over the horizontal t axis:   Graph of    A basic square root graph with initial point at the origin, increasing to the right      Graph of reflected vertically    A vertically-flipped square root graph with initial point at the origin, decreasing to the right     Since each output value is the opposite of the original output value, we can write .  Notice this is an outside change or vertical change that affects the output values, so the negative sign belongs outside of the function. Reflecting horizontally, each input value will be reflected over the vertical axis.   Graph of reflected horizontally    A horizontally-flipped square root graph decreasing to the origin and terminating     Since each input value is the opposite of the original input value, we can write .  Notice this is an inside change or horizontal change that affects the input values, so the negative sign is on the inside of the function.  Note that these transformations can affect the domain and range of the functions. While the original square root function has domain and range , the vertical reflection gives the function the range , and the horizontal reflection gives the function the domain .     Reflections   Given a function , if we define a new function as , then is a vertical reflection of the function , sometimes called a reflection about the horizontal axis.  If we define a new function as , then is a horizontal reflection of the function , sometimes called a reflection about the vertical axis.      A function is given as a table below. Create a table for the function and .                 2  4  6  8       1  3  7  11    For , this is a vertical reflection, so the values stay the same and each output value will be the opposite of the original output value:                 2  4  6  8       -1  -3  -7  -11    For , this is a horizontal reflection, and each input value will be the opposite of the original input value and the values stay the same as the values:                 -2  -4  -6  -8       1  3  7  11        A common model for learning has an equation similar to , where is the percentage of mastery that can be achieved after practice sessions. This is a transformation of the function shown here.   Graph of    An increasing curving-up graph, passing through 0 comma 1     Sketch a graph of . This equation combines three transformations into one equation.   A horizontal reflection:     A vertical reflection:     A vertical shift up 1:      We can sketch a graph by applying these transformations one at a time to the original function:   Original graph of     An increasing curving-up graph, passing through 0 comma 1      Horizontally Reflected:     A horizontal flip of the previous graph, now decreasing curving-up, passing through 0 comma 1      Then vertically reflected:     A vertical flip of the previous graph, now increasing curving-down, passing through 0 comma negative 1      Then shifted vertically:     A shift up 1 of the previous graph, now increasing curving-down, passing through 0 comma 0     Note: As a model for learning, this function would be limited to a domain of , with corresponding range .     Given the toolkit function , graph and . Do you notice anything surprising?   Some functions exhibit symmetry, in which reflections result in the original graph. For example, reflecting the toolkit functions or about the -axis will result in the original graph. We call these types of graphs symmetric about the -axis.  Likewise, if the graphs of or were reflected over both axes, the result would be the original graph:       A standard cubic graph, increasing curving down to the origin, then increasing curving up          A horizontal flip of a standard cubic graph, decreasing curving up then decreasing curving down          A vertical and horizontal flip of a standard cubic graph, with the result looking like a standard cubic graph     We call these graphs symmetric about the origin.    Stretches and Compressions  With shifts, we saw the effect of adding or subtracting to the inputs or outputs of a function. We now explore the effects of multiplying the inputs or outputs.  Remember, we can transform the inside (input values) of a function, or we can transform the outside (output values) of a function. Each change has a specific effect that can be seen graphically.    A function models the growth of a population of fruit flies. The growth is shown in the graph.     A piecewise function that passes through 0 comma 1, 3 comma 3, 6 comma 2, and 7 comma 0     A scientist is comparing this to another population, , that grows the same way, but starts twice as large. Sketch a graph of this population.  Since the population is always twice as large, the new population’s output values are always twice the original function output values. Graphically, this would look like the second graph shown.  Symbolically, .     A piecewise function that passes through 0 comma 2, 3 comma 6, 6 comma 4, and 7 comma 0     This means that for any input , the value of the function is twice the value of the function. Notice the effect on the graph is a vertical stretching of the graph, where every point doubles its distance from the horizontal axis. The input values, , stay the same while the output values are twice as large as before.     Vertical Stretch and Compression   Given a function , if we define a new function as , where is a constant then is a vertical stretch or compression of the function .  If , then the graph will be stretched vertically. If , then the graph will be compressed vertically. If , then there will be combination of a vertical stretch or compression with a vertical reflection.      A function is given as a table below.                 2  4  6  8       1  3  7  11    Create a table for the function . The formula tells us that the output values of are half of the output values of with the same inputs. For example, we know that . Then .                 2  4  6  8                     The result is that the function has been compressed vertically by . Each output value has been cut in half, so the graph would now be half the original height.      The graph shown is a transformation of the toolkit function . Relate this new function to , then find a formula for .     A transformation of a basic cubic graph, passing through the origin and passing through 2 comma 2     When trying to determine a vertical stretch or shift, it is helpful to look for a point on the graph that is relatively clear. In this graph, it appears that . With the basic cubic function at the same input, .  Based on that, it appears that the outputs of are the outputs of the function , since .  From this we can fairly safely conclude that: .  We can write a formula for by using the definition of the function . .    Now we consider changes to the inside of a function.    Returning to the fruit fly population we looked at earlier, suppose the scientist is now comparing it to a population that progresses through its lifespan twice as fast as the original population. In other words, this new population, , will progress in 1 hour the same amount the original population did in 2 hours, and in 2 hours, will progress as much as the original population did in 4 hours. Sketch a graph of this population.  Symbolically, we could write , , and in general, .  Graphing this,   Original population     A piecewise function that passes through 0 comma 1, 3 comma 3, 6 comma 2, and 7 comma 0      Transformed population     A piecewise function that passes through 0 comma 1, 1.5 comma 3, 3 comma 2, and 3.5 comma 0     Note the effect on the graph is a horizontal compression, where all input values are half their original distance from the vertical axis.     Horizontal Stretch\/Compression   Given a function , if we define a new function as , where is a constant then is a horizontal stretch or compression of the function .  If , then the graph will be compressed by a factor of . If , then the graph will be stretched by a factor of . If , then there will be combination of a horizontal stretch or compression with a horizontal reflection.      A function is given as a table below. Create a table for the function .                 2  4  6  8       1  3  5  11    The formula tells us that the output values for are the same as the output values for the function at an input half the size. Notice that we don’t have enough information to determine since , and we do not have a value for in our table. Our input values to will need to be twice as large to get inputs for that we can evaluate. For example, we can determine since .                 4  8  12  16       1  3  7  11    Since each input value has been doubled, the result is that the function has been stretched horizontally by a factor of 2.      Two graphs are shown below. Relate the function to .   Graph of     A piecewise function that passes through 0 comma 0, 4 comma 4 and 6 comma 4      Graph of     A piecewise function that passes through 0 comma 0, 2 comma 4 and 3 comma 4     The graph of looks like the graph of horizontally compressed. Since ends at and ends at we can see that the values have been compressed by , because . We might also notice that , and . Either way, we can describe this relationship as . This is a horizontal compression by .    Notice that the coefficient needed for a horizontal stretch or compression is the reciprocal of the stretch or compression. To stretch the graph horizontally by 4, we need a coefficient of in our function: . This means the input values must be four times larger to produce the same result, requiring the input to be larger, causing the horizontal stretching.   Write a formula for the toolkit square root function horizontally stretched by three.   It is useful to note that for most toolkit functions, a horizontal stretch or vertical stretch can be represented in other ways. For example, a horizontal compression of the function by would result in a new function , but this can also be written as , a vertical stretch of by 4. When writing a formula for a transformed toolkit, we only need to find one transformation that would produce the graph.    Combining Transformations  When combining transformations, it is very important to consider the order of the transformations. For example, vertically shifting by 3 and then vertically stretching by 2 does not create the same graph as vertically stretching by 2 then vertically shifting by 3.  When we see an expression like , which transformation should we start with? The answer here follows nicely from order of operations, for outside transformations. Given the output value of , we first multiply by 2, causing the vertical stretch, then add 3, causing the vertical shift. (Multiplication before Addition)   Combining Vertical Transformations   When combining vertical transformations written in the form , first vertically stretch by , then vertically shift by .    Horizontal transformations are a little trickier to think about. When we write for example, we have to think about how the inputs to the function relate to the inputs to the function. Suppose we know . What input to would produce that output? In other words, what value of will allow ? We would need . To solve for , we would first subtract 3, resulting in horizontal shift, then divide by 2, causing a horizontal compression.   Combining Horizontal Transformations   When combining horizontal transformations written in the form , first horizontally shift by , then horizontally stretch by .    This format ends up being very difficult to work with, since it is usually much easier to horizontally stretch a graph before shifting. We can work around this by factoring inside the function. Factoring in this way allows us to horizontally stretch first, then shift horizontally.   Combining Horizontal Transformations (Factored Form)   When combining horizontal transformations written in the form , first horizontally stretch by , then horizontally shift by .     Independence of Horizontal and Vertical Transformations   Horizontal and vertical transformations are independent. It does not matter whether horizontal or vertical transformations are done first.      Given the table of values for the function below, create a table of values for the function .                 6  12  18  24       10  14  15  17    There are 3 steps to this transformation, and we will work from the inside out. Starting with the horizontal transformations, is a horizontal compression by , which means we multiply each value by .                 2  4  6  8       10  14  15  17    Looking now to the vertical transformations, we start with the vertical stretch, which will multiply the output values by 2. We apply this to the previous transformation.                 2  4  6  8       20  28  30  34    Finally, we can apply the vertical shift, which will add 1 to all the output values.                 2  4  6  8       21  29  31  35        Using the graph of below, sketch a graph of .   Graph of     A semi-circle with endpoints at negative 2 comma 0 and 2 comma 0 and passing through 0 comma 2     To make things simpler, we’ll start by factoring out the inside of the function .  By factoring the inside, we can first horizontally stretch by 2, as indicated by the on the inside of the function. Remember twice the size of 0 is still 0, so the point remains at while the point will stretch to . Next, we horizontally shift left by 2 units, as indicated by the .  Last, we vertically shift down by 3 to complete our sketch, as indicated by the -3 on the outside of the function.   Horizontal stretch by 2    A horizontally stretched semi-circle with endpoints at negative 4 comma 0 and 4 comma 0 and passing through 0 comma 2      Horizontal shift left by 2    A horizontally stretched and shifted semi-circle with endpoints at negative 6 comma 0 and 2 comma 0 and passing through negative 2 comma 2      Vertical shift down by 3    A horizontally stretched and shifted semi-circle with endpoints at negative 6 comma negative 3 and 2 comma negative 3 and passing through negative 2 comma negative 1         Write an equation for the transformed graph of the quadratic function shown.     A downwards opening parabola with vertex at negative 3 comma 1 and passing through 2 comma negative 1 and 4 comma negative 1     Since this is a quadratic function, first consider what the basic quadratic tool kit function looks like and how this has changed. Observing the graph, we notice several transformations:  The original tool kit function has been flipped over the -axis, some kind of stretch or compression has occurred, and we can see a shift to the right 3 units and a shift up 1 unit.  In total there are four operations:   Vertical reflection, requiring a negative sign outside the function    Vertical Stretch or Horizontal Compression*    Horizontal Shift Right 3 units, which tells us to put on the inside of the function    Vertical Shift up 1 unit, telling us to add 1 on the outside of the function     * It is unclear from the graph whether it is showing a vertical stretch or a horizontal compression. For the quadratic, it turns out we could represent it either way, so we’ll use a vertical stretch. You may be able to determine the vertical stretch by observation.  By observation, the basic tool kit function has a vertex at and symmetrical points at and . These points are one unit up and one unit over from the vertex. The new points on the transformed graph are one unit away horizontally but 2 units away vertically. They have been stretched vertically by two.  Not everyone can see this by simply looking at the graph. If you can, great, but if not, we can solve for it. First, we will write the equation for this graph, with an unknown vertical stretch.  The original function is . To vertically reflect: . To vertically stretch: . To shift right by 3 units: . To shift up by 1 unit: .  We now know our graph is going to have an equation of the form . To find the vertical stretch, we can identify any point on the graph (other than the highest point), such as the point , which tells us . Using our general formula, and substituting 2 for , and -1 for :        This tells us that to produce the graph we need a vertical stretch by two. The function that produces this graph is therefore .      Consider the linear function . Describe its transformation in words using the identity tool kit function as a reference.      On what interval(s) is the function increasing and decreasing?  This is a transformation of the toolkit reciprocal squared function, :  A vertical flip and vertical stretch by 2:   A shift right by 1:   A shift up by 3:   The basic reciprocal squared function is increasing on and decreasing on . Because of the vertical flip, the function will be decreasing on the left and increasing on the right. The horizontal shift right by 1 will also shift these intervals to the right one. From this, we can determine will be increasing on and decreasing on . We also could graph the transformation to help us determine these intervals.

The new points on the transformed graph are one unit away horizontally but 2 units away vertically. They have been stretched vertically by two.

  "body": " Inverse Functions   Definitions  A fashion designer is traveling to Milan for a fashion show. He asks his assistant, Betty, what 75 degrees Fahrenheit is in Celsius, and after a quick search on Google, she finds the formula . Using this formula, she calculates degrees Celsius. The next day, the designer sends his assistant the week’s weather forecast for Milan and asks her to convert the temperatures to Fahrenheit.     A weather forecast for four days with temperatures in Celsius.     At first, Betty might consider using the formula she has already found to do the conversions. After all, she knows her algebra, and can easily solve the equation for F after substituting a value for C. For example, to convert 26 degrees Celsius, she could write: ,   ,   .  After considering this option for a moment, she realizes that solving the equation for each of the temperatures would get awfully tedious, and realizes that since evaluation is easier than solving, it would be much more convenient to have a different formula, one which takes the Celsius temperature and outputs the Fahrenheit temperature. This is the idea of an inverse function, where the input becomes the output, and the output becomes the input.   Inverse Function   If , then a function is an inverse of if . The inverse of a function is typically notated , which is read “f inverse”, so equivalently, if then .    Important: The superscripts -1 used in the notation for inverse functions is simply a notation, and does not designate an exponent or power of -1.    If for a particular function, , what do we know about the inverse?  The inverse function reverses which quantity is input and which quantity is output, so if , then .  Alternatively, if you want to re-name the inverse function , then .     Given that , what do we know about the original function ?   Notice that the original function and the inverse function undo each other. If , then , returning us to the original input. More simply put, if you compose these functions together you get the original input as your answer. and .     A diagram showing two circles, one labeled domain of f with a point labeled a in the circle, and the other labeled Range of f with a point labeled b in the circle. An arrow labeled f of x points from a to b. An arrow labeled f inverse of x points from b to a.     Since the outputs of the function are the inputs to , the range of is also the domain of . Likewise, since the inputs to are the outputs of , the domain of is the range of .  Basically, like how the input and output values switch, the domain and ranges switch as well. But be careful, because sometimes a function doesn’t even have an inverse function, or only has an inverse on a limited domain. For example, the inverse of is , since a square “undoes” a square root, but it is only the inverse of on the domain , since that is the range of .    The function has domain and range , what would we expect the domain and range of to be?  We would expect to swap the domain and range of , so would have domain and range .

So, in the expression , the 70 is an output value of the original function, representing 70 miles. The inverse will return the corresponding input of the original function , 90 minutes, so . Interpreting this, it means that to drive 70 miles, it took 90 minutes.  Alternatively, recall the definition of the inverse was that if then . By this definition, if you are given then you are looking for a value so that . In this case, we are looking for a so that , which is when .

Using the graph in the example above   find     estimate         Returning to our designer’s assistant, find a formula for the inverse function that gives Fahrenheit temperature given a Celsius temperature.  A quick Google search would find the inverse function, but alternatively, Betty might look back at how she solved for the Fahrenheit temperature for a specific Celsius value, and repeat the process in general. ,   ,   .  By solving in general, we have uncovered the inverse function. If Then     It is important to note that not all functions will have an inverse function. Since the function takes an output of and returns an input of , in order for to itself be a function, then each output of (input to ) must correspond to exactly one input of (output of ). You might recall that this is the definition of a one-to-one function.   Properties of Inverses   In order for a function to have an inverse, it must be a one-to-one function.    In some cases, it is desirable to have an inverse for a function even though the function is not one-to-one. In those cases, we can often limit the domain of the original function to an interval on which the function is one-to-one, then find an inverse only on that interval.
