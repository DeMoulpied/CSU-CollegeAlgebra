  <title>Transformations</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
        Often when given a problem, we try to model the scenario using mathematics in the form of words, tables, graphs, and equations in order to explain or solve it.
        When building models, it is often helpful to build from existing formulas or models.
        Knowing the basic graphs of your tool-kit functions can help you solve problems by being able to model new behavior by adapting something you already know.
        Unfortunately, the models and existing formulas we know are not always the same as the ones presented in the problems we face.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fortunately, there are systematic ways to shift, stretch, compress, flip and combine functions to help them become better models for the problems we are trying to solve.
        We can transform what we already know into what we need, hence the name, “Transformation of functions.” When we have a story problem, formula, graph, or table, we can then transform that function in a variety of ways to form new functions.

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    To regulate temperature in a green building, air flow vents near the roof open and close throughout the day to allow warm air to escape.
                    The graph below shows the open vents <m>V</m> (in square feet) throughout the day, <m>t</m> in hours after midnight.
                    During the summer, the facilities staff decides to try to better regulate temperature by increasing the amount of open vents by 20 square feet throughout the day.
                    Sketch a graph of this new function.
                </p>

        <solution>
                <p>
                    We can sketch a graph of this new function by adding 20 to each of the output values of the original function.
                    This will have the effect of shifting the graph up.
                </p>

                <figure xml:id="c1s6i2">

                <p>
                    Notice that in the second graph, for each input value, the output value has increased by twenty, so if we call the new function <m>S(t)</m>, we could write <m>S(t)=V(t)+20</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that this notation tells us that for any value of <m>t</m>, <m>S(t)</m> can be found by evaluating the <m>V</m> function at the same input, then adding twenty to the result.
                    This defines <m>S</m> as a transformation of the function <m>V</m>, in this case a vertical shift up 20 units.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Notice that with a vertical shift the input values stay the same and only the output values change.

                    Given a function <m>f(x)</m>, if we define a new function <m>g(x)</m> as <m>g(x)=f(x)+k</m>, where <m>k</m> is a constant, then <m>g(x)</m> is a vertical shift of the function <m>f(x)</m>, where all the output values have been increased by <m>k</m>.
                    If <m>k</m> is positive, then the graph will shift up by <m>k</m> units.
                    If <m>k</m> is negative, then the graph will shift down by <m>k</m> units.

                <p>
                    The formula <m>g(x)=f(x)-3</m> tells us that we can find the output values of the <m>g</m> function by subtracting 3 from the output values of the <m>f</m> function.
                    For example, <m>f(2)=1</m> is found from the given table.
                    <m>g(x)=f(x)-3</m> is our given transformation, so <m>g(2)=f(2)-3=1-3=-2</m>.
                    Subtracting 3 from each <m>f(x)</m> value, we can complete a table of values for <m>g(x)</m>,

            <statement>
                <p>
                    The function <m>a(t)=-4.9t^{2}+30t</m> gives the height <m>h</m> of a ball (in meters) thrown upwards from the ground after <m>t</m> seconds.
                    Suppose the ball was instead thrown from the top of a 10-meter building.
                    Relate this new height function <m>b(t)</m> to <m>a(t)</m>, then find a formula for <m>b(t)</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </exercise>

        <p>
            The vertical shift is a change to the output, or outside, of the function.
            We will now look at how changes to input, on the inside of the function, change its graph and meaning.
        </p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Returning to our building air flow example from the beginning of the section, suppose that in fall, the facilities staff decides that the original venting plan starts too late, and they want to move the entire venting program to start two hours earlier.
                    Sketch a graph of the new function.
                </p>

                    In the new graph, which we can call <m>F(t)</m>, at each time, the air flow is the same as the original function <m>V(t)</m> was two hours later.
                    For example, in the original function <m>V</m>, the air flow starts to change at 8 am, while for the function <m>F(t)</m> the air flow starts to change at 6 am.
                    The comparable function values are <m>V(8)=F(6)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Notice also that the vents first opened to 220 sq.
                    ft.
                    at 10 am under the original plan, while under the new plan the vents reach 220 sq.
                    ft.
                    at 8 am, so <m>V(10)=F(8)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In both cases we see that since <m>F(t)</m> starts 2 hours sooner, the same output values are reached when, <m>F(t)=V(t+2)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that <m>V(t+2)</m> had the effect of shifting the graph to the left.

        </example>

        <p>
            Horizontal changes or “inside changes” affect the domain of a function (the input) instead of the range and often seem counterintuitive.
            The new function <m>F(t)</m> uses the same outputs as <m>V(t)</m> but matches those outputs to inputs two hours earlier than those of <m>V(t)</m>.
            Said another way, we must add 2 hours to the input of <m>V</m> to find the corresponding output for <m>F</m>: <m>F(t)=V(t+2)</m>.

                    If <m>k</m> is positive, then the graph will shift left by <m>k</m> units.

                    For example, we know that <m>f(2)=1</m>.
                    To get the same output from the <m>g</m> function, we will need an input value that is 3 larger: We input a value that is three larger for <m>g(x)</m> because the function takes three away before evaluating the function <m>f</m>.

                    The result is that the function <m>g(x)</m> has been shifted to the right by 3.
                    Notice the output values for <m>g(x)</m> remain the same as the output values for <m>f(x)</m> in the chart, but the corresponding input values, <m>x</m>, have shifted to the right by 3: 2 shifted to 5, 4 shifted to 7, 6 shifted to 9 and 8 shifted to 11.

                <p>
                    Notice that the graph looks almost identical in shape to the <m>f(x)=x^{2}</m> function, but the <m>x</m> values are shifted to the right two units.
                    The vertex used to be at <m>(0, 0)</m> but now the vertex is at <m>(2, 0)</m>.
                    The graph is the basic quadratic function shifted two to the right, so <m>g(x)=f(x-2)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Notice how we must input the value <m>x = 2</m>, to get the output value <m>y = 0</m>; the <m>x</m> values must be two units larger, because of the shift to the right by 2 units.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can then use the definition of the <m>f(x)</m> function to write a formula for <m>g(x)</m> by evaluating <m>f(x-2)</m>: Since <m>f(x)=x^{2}</m> and <m>g(x)=f(x-2)</m>.
                    Thus, <m>g(x)=f(x-2)=(x-2)^{2}</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you find yourself having trouble determining whether the shift is +2 or -2, it might help to consider a single point on the graph.
                    For a quadratic, looking at the bottom-most point is convenient.
                    In the original function, <m>f(0)=0</m>.
                    In our shifted function, <m>g(2)=0</m>.
                    To obtain the output value of 0 from the <m>f</m> function, we need to decide whether a +2 or -2 will work to satisfy <m>g(2)=f(2-2)=f(0)=0</m>.
                    For this to work, we will need to subtract 2 from our input values.

        </example>

        <p>
            When thinking about horizontal and vertical shifts, it is good to keep in mind that vertical shifts are affecting the output values of the function, while horizontal shifts are affecting the input values of the function.

                    The function <m>G(m)</m> gives the number of gallons of gas required to drive <m>m</m> miles.

                <p>
                    <m>G(m)+10</m> is adding 10 to the output, gallons. This is 10 gallons of gas more than is required to drive <m>m</m> miles. So, this is the gas required to drive <m>m</m> miles, plus another 10 gallons of gas.

                <p>
                    <m>G(m+10)</m> is adding 10 to the input, miles. This is the number of gallons of gas required to drive 10 miles more than <m>m</m> miles.

                    The graph of the toolkit function starts at the origin, so this graph has been shifted 1 to the right, and up 2.

                <p>
                    Note that this transformation has changed the domain and range of the function.

            Another transformation that can be applied to a function is a reflection over the horizontal or vertical axis.

                <p>
                    Notice this is an outside change or vertical change that affects the output <m>s(t)</m> values, so the negative sign belongs outside of the function.

                    Note that these transformations can affect the domain and range of the functions.
                    While the original square root function has domain <m>[0,\infty)</m> and range <m>[0,\infty)</m>, the vertical reflection gives the <m>V(t)</m> function the range <m>(-\infty,0]</m>, and the horizontal reflection gives the <m>H(t)</m> function the domain <m>(-\infty,0]</m>.

            Some functions exhibit symmetry, in which reflections result in the original graph.
            For example, reflecting the toolkit functions <m>f(x)=x^{2}</m> or <m>f(x)=|x|</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis will result in the original graph.
            We call these types of graphs symmetric about the <m>y</m>-axis.

        <p>
            Likewise, if the graphs of <m>f(x)=x^{3}</m> or <m>f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x}</m> were reflected over both axes, the result would be the original graph:

        <title>Stretches and Compressions</title>

        <p>
            With shifts, we saw the effect of adding or subtracting to the inputs or outputs of a function.
            We now explore the effects of multiplying the inputs or outputs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember, we can transform the inside (input values) of a function, or we can transform the outside (output values) of a function.
            Each change has a specific effect that can be seen graphically.
        </p>

            <statement>

                    The growth is shown in the graph.

                <p>
                    When trying to determine a vertical stretch or shift, it is helpful to look for a point on the graph that is relatively clear.
                    In this graph, it appears that <m>g(2)=2</m>.
                    With the basic cubic function at the same input, <m>f(2)=2^{3}=8</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Based on that, it appears that the outputs of <m>g</m> are <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m> the outputs of the function <m>f</m>, since <m>g(2)=\dfrac{1}{4}f(2)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From this we can fairly safely conclude that: <m>g(x)=\dfrac{1}{4}f(x)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can write a formula for <m>g</m> by using the definition of the function <m>f</m>.
                    <m>g(x)=\dfrac{1}{4}f(x)=\dfrac{1}{4}x^{3}</m>.

                    Returning to the fruit fly population we looked at earlier, suppose the scientist is now comparing it to a population that progresses through its lifespan twice as fast as the original population.
                    In other words, this new population, <m>R</m>, will progress in 1 hour the same amount the original population did in 2 hours, and in 2 hours, will progress as much as the original population did in 4 hours.
                    Sketch a graph of this population.

                    Notice that we don’t have enough information to determine <m>g(2)</m> since <m>g(2)=f(\dfrac{1}{2}*2)=f(1)</m>, and we do not have a value for <m>f(1)</m> in our table.
                    Our input values to <m>g</m> will need to be twice as large to get inputs for <m>f</m> that we can evaluate.
                    For example, we can determine <m>g(4)</m> since <m>g(4)=f(\dfrac{1}{2}* 4)=f(2)=1</m>.

                <p>
                    The graph of <m>g(x)</m> looks like the graph of <m>f(x)</m> horizontally compressed.
                    Since <m>f(x)</m> ends at <m>(6,4)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> ends at <m>(2,4)</m> we can see that the <m>x</m> values have been compressed by <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m>, because <m>6(\dfrac{1}{3}) = 2</m>.
                    We might also notice that <m>g(2)=f(6)</m>, and <m>g(1)=f(3)</m>.
                    Either way, we can describe this relationship as <m>g(x)=f(3x)</m>.
                    This is a horizontal compression by <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m>.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>
            Notice that the coefficient needed for a horizontal stretch or compression is the reciprocal of the stretch or compression.
            To stretch the graph horizontally by 4, we need a coefficient of <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m> in our function: <m>f(\dfrac{1}{4}x)</m>.
            This means the input values must be four times larger to produce the same result, requiring the input to be larger, causing the horizontal stretching.

        </exercise>

        <p>
            It is useful to note that for most toolkit functions, a horizontal stretch or vertical stretch can be represented in other ways.
            For example, a horizontal compression of the function <m>f(x)=x^{2}</m> by <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> would result in a new function <m>g(x)=(2x)^{2}</m>, but this can also be written as <m>g(x)=4x^{2}</m>, a vertical stretch of <m>f(x)</m> by 4.
            When writing a formula for a transformed toolkit, we only need to find one transformation that would produce the graph.

        <title>Combining Transformations</title>

        <p>
            When combining transformations, it is very important to consider the order of the transformations.
            For example, vertically shifting by 3 and then vertically stretching by 2 does not create the same graph as vertically stretching by 2 then vertically shifting by 3.
        </p>

        <p>
            When we see an expression like <m>2f(x)+3</m>, which transformation should we start with? The answer here follows nicely from order of operations, for outside transformations.
            Given the output value of <m>f(x)</m>, we first multiply by 2, causing the vertical stretch, then add 3, causing the vertical shift.
            (Multiplication before Addition)
        </p>

            <title>Combining Vertical Transformations</title>

            <statement>
                <p>
                    When combining vertical transformations written in the form <m>af(x)+k</m>, first vertically stretch by <m>a</m>, then vertically shift by <m>k</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>
            Horizontal transformations are a little trickier to think about.
            When we write <m>g(x)=f(2x+3)</m> for example, we have to think about how the inputs to the <m>g</m> function relate to the inputs to the <m>f</m> function.
            Suppose we know <m>f(7)=12</m>.
            What input to <m>g</m> would produce that output? In other words, what value of <m>x</m> will allow <m>g(x)=f(2x+3)=f(12)</m>? We would need <m>2x+3=12</m>.
            To solve for <m>x</m>, we would first subtract 3, resulting in horizontal shift, then divide by 2, causing a horizontal compression.
        </p>

        <definition>
            <title>Combining Horizontal Transformations</title>

            <statement>
                <p>
                    When combining horizontal transformations written in the form <m>f(bx+p)</m>, first horizontally shift by <m>p</m>, then horizontally stretch by <m>\dfrac{1}{b}</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>
            This format ends up being very difficult to work with, since it is usually much easier to horizontally stretch a graph before shifting.
            We can work around this by factoring inside the function.
            <me>
                f(bx+p) = f(b(x+\dfrac{p}{b}))
            </me>
            Factoring in this way allows us to horizontally stretch first, then shift horizontally.

                    To make things simpler, we'll start by factoring out the inside of the function <m>f(\dfrac{1}{2}x+1)-3=f(\dfrac{1}{2}(x+2))-3</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By factoring the inside, we can first horizontally stretch by 2, as indicated by the <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> on the inside of the function.
                    Remember twice the size of 0 is still 0, so the point <m>(0,2)</m> remains at <m>(0,2)</m> while the point <m>(2,0)</m> will stretch to <m>(4,0)</m>.
                    Next, we horizontally shift left by 2 units, as indicated by the <m>x+2</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Last, we vertically shift down by 3 to complete our sketch, as indicated by the -3 on the outside of the function.

                    Since this is a quadratic function, first consider what the basic quadratic tool kit function looks like and how this has changed.
                    Observing the graph, we notice several transformations:
                </p>

                <p>
                    The original tool kit function has been flipped over the <m>x</m>-axis, some kind of stretch or compression has occurred, and we can see a shift to the right 3 units and a shift up 1 unit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In total there are four operations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Vertical reflection, requiring a negative sign outside the function
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Vertical Stretch or Horizontal Compression*
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Horizontal Shift Right 3 units, which tells us to put <m>x-3</m> on the inside of the function
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Vertical Shift up 1 unit, telling us to add 1 on the outside of the function
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    * It is unclear from the graph whether it is showing a vertical stretch or a horizontal compression.
                    For the quadratic, it turns out we could represent it either way, so we’ll use a vertical stretch.
                    You may be able to determine the vertical stretch by observation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By observation, the basic tool kit function has a vertex at <m>(0, 0)</m> and symmetrical points at <m>(1, 1)</m> and <m>(-1, 1)</m>.
                    These points are one unit up and one unit over from the vertex.
                    The new points on the transformed graph are one unit away horizontally but 2 units away vertically.
                    They have been stretched vertically by two.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not everyone can see this by simply looking at the graph.
                    If you can, great, but if not, we can solve for it.
                    First, we will write the equation for this graph, with an unknown vertical stretch.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The original function is <m>f(x)=x^{2}</m>.
                    To vertically reflect: <m>-f(x)=-x^{2}</m>.
                    To vertically stretch: <m>-af(x)=-ax^{2}</m>.
                    To shift right by 3 units: <m>-af(x-3)=-a(x-3)^{2}</m>.
                    To shift up by 1 unit: <m>-af(x-3)+1=-a(x-3)^{2}+1</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We now know our graph is going to have an equation of the form <m>g(x)=-a(x-3)^{2}+1</m>.
                    To find the vertical stretch, we can identify any point on the graph (other than the highest point), such as the point <m>(2, -1)</m>, which tells us <m>g(2)=-1</m>.
                    Using our general formula, and substituting 2 for <m>x</m>, and -1 for <m>g(x)</m>:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <me>
                        -1=-a(2-3)^{2}+1
                    </me>
                    <me>
                        -1=-a+1
                    </me>
                    <me>
                        -2=-a
                    </me>
                    <me>
                        2=a
                    </me>
                </p>

                <p>
                    This tells us that to produce the graph we need a vertical stretch by two.
                    The function that produces this graph is therefore <m>g(x)=-2(x-3)^{2}+1</m>.

                    This is a transformation of the toolkit reciprocal squared function, <m>f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^2}</m>:

                <p>
                    A shift right by 1: <m>-2f(x-1)=\dfrac{-2}{(x-1)^2}</m>

                <p>
                    A shift up by 3: <m>-2f(x-1)+3=\dfrac{-2}{(x-1)^2}+3</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The basic reciprocal squared function is increasing on <m>(-\infty,0)</m> and decreasing on <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
                    Because of the vertical flip, the <m>g(x)</m> function will be decreasing on the left and increasing on the right.
                    The horizontal shift right by 1 will also shift these intervals to the right one.
                    From this, we can determine <m>g(x)</m> will be increasing on <m>(1,\infty)</m> and decreasing on <m>(-\infty,1)</m>.
                    We also could graph the transformation to help us determine these intervals.
